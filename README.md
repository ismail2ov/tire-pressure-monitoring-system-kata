# Tire Pressure Monitoring System Kata

## Given

**Alarm class:** monitors tire pressure and sets an alarm if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. 

**Sensor class:** simulates the behavior of a real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.

## Goal

- Write the unit tests for the Alarm class. 
- Refactor the code as much as you need to make the Alarm class testable. 
- Minimize changes to the public API as much as you can.

* _**Extra credits:** Alarm class fails to follow one or more of the SOLID principles. Write down the line number, the principle & the violation._


## How to do it?

1. Test the code using test doubles created by you.

2. Test the code using test doubles created with a library.

## Learnings
 
- How to build a Stub and a Spy manually.

- How to use Mockito to generate the test doubles.
